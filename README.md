- **_News (2023-09-28)_**: ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Our code has been released!
- **_News (2023-09-22)_**: ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations on CRoSS being accepted by NeurIPS 2023! Our open-source project is making progress, stay tuned for updates!

## Quick Run
```bash
ls -la
```
Feel free to try it on your own images and keys. More sampling steps usually lead to better results.

## Introduction

![](./method-cross-v2_00.png)

Inspired by recent developments in diffusion models, we propose a novel image steganography framework named **C**ontrollable, **Ro**bust, and **S**ecure Image **S**teganography (**CRoSS**). This framework offers significant advantages in **controllability** over container images, **robustness** against complex degradation during transmission of container images, and enhanced **security** compared to cover-based image steganography methods. Importantly, these benefits are achieved **without requiring additional training**.

## Results about Robustness 

Following are visual comparisons of our **CRoSS** and other methods under two real-world degradations, namely `WeChat` and `Shoot`. Obviously, our method can reconstruct the content of secret images, while other methods exhibit significant color distortion or have completely failed. 

*Details and more results can be found in our paper.*

## Results about Security 

Following are deep steganalysis results by the latest [SID](http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/research/Scale-1.12.16.pdf). As the number of leaked samples increases, methods whose detection accuracy curves grow more slowly and approach $50\%$ exhibit higher security. The right is the recall curve of different methods under the [StegExpose](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.6656v1.pdf) detector. The closer the area enclosed by the curve and the coordinate axis is to 0.5, the closer the method is to the ideal evasion of the detector. 

*Details and more results can be found in our paper.*
